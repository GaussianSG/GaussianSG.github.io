    description: "Gaussian can orchestrate multiple LLM \"experts\" (e.g., quality‑control, maintenance, scheduling) while running a digital twin of the assembly line to raise overall equipment effectiveness. GaussFlow decomposes the high‑level goal \"cut defect rate by 3 % this quarter\" into sub‑tasks such as root‑cause analysis of weld failures, schedule optimization for robot maintenance, and real‑time parameter tuning.",
